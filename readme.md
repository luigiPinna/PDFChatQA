# Ask PDF

This is a Python application that allows you to load a PDF and ask questions about it using natural language. The application uses a LLM to generate a response about your PDF. The LLM will not answer questions unrelated to the document.


## Installation

To install the repository, please clone this repository and install the requirements:

```

You will also need to add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.

## Usage

```
streamlit run app.py
```
